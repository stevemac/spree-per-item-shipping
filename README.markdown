= Per Item Shipping

Sometimes, especially with large and expensive to ship items
it makes business sense to have a flat shipping rate which
can be different for every product.

This extension adds a shipping method named 'per_item_shipping' and
a field on the product edit page where you can set the shipping 
cost that product.
